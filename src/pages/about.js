      <p><b>About me:</b> I'm concise. Also, currently unemployed and about to imminently seek work, after taking a mid-life gap year.  Created this website to organise my current projects.
      I took some time away from work to travel, somewhat like a gap year, which turned more into a study year!  I spent the year studying Mandarin, I achieved HSK5 level, which is typical university entrance level minimum, but general TV is still too difficult.
