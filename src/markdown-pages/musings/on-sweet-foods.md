###### Biscuits and chocolate
Supermarket choices in biscuits and chocolates hardly ever change and are incredibly boring.  It is very expensive to bring in a new product so we are rather stuck in the situation where few new products will appear.  I see this as symptomatic of globalisation and the race to the cheapest solution.  Big cities and countries have a tendency to become increasingly similar at a loss to the diversity of the world (far beyond mere sweets).

Around the world, Thailand's "Mango sticky rice" and Taiwan's "Mango shaved ice" (and interesting variants) are among my faves!
